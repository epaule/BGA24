# Eukaryotic Annotation

# Description

This is a workshop on eukaryotic gene annotation using [BRAKER](https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/BRAKER) developed by Katharina Hoff et.al. We will cover alternative tools and cases where manual intervention might be needed.

# Data

* The data chromosome 1 of the ASG Crambe crambe assembly published as [GCA_963924555.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_963924555.1/)
* RNASeq is a subsample of mRNA SRA submissions created by [VARUS](https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/VARUS) (Bruhn et al. 2019, BMC Bioinformatics, 20:558)
